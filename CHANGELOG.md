# Change Log
I didn't do this from the start unfortunately... so lots of decisions and their reasoning will forever be forgotten. But better late than never, here's the latest updates

NLTK is back to working!
Problems were some missing nltk_data packages and some remaining python 2 to 3 upgrade issues.
Thanks ChatGPT for your support.

I noticed that TLC is not working anymore :(
This was because Heroku doesn't do free anymore (fair enough) but it also stopped supporting Python 2 code :(((
So if I want to keep TLC alive I will have to
- start paying for Heroku
- update the Python version (and all the other packages as well - I guess)
- fix all the broken things that come with package updates and major Python version jumps. Fun!
