        """
        Create a recognition rule, with a number of optional arguments. All
        regex's are in the form to be used with nltk.TokenSearcher.findall
        (http://nltk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/api/nltk.text.TokenSearcher-class.html#findall)
        however with the amendment that the body of the tokens are actually in
        the form <token~POS>, e.g., <about~.+> would match about with any POS
        tag.
        
        match is a regex. The text that is matched by this regex is annotated as
            a timex. Compulsory.
        type can be date, time or duration (TIMEX3 annotation guidelines). This
            is a compulsory value.
        id is a unique value other rules can refer to in order to express an
            ordering.
        guards is a list of regexes which must be satisfied for this rule to be
            applied. Defauts to an empty list. If the first character in the
            regex is a !, then it means that it's a negative guard - the guard
            must NOT match for this rule to be applied.
        after_guards is a list of regexes, like normal guards, but is only
            matched against the string immediately proceeding a match to check
            if that is satisfied
        before_guards is like after_guards, but matches against the string
            immediately preceeding a match
        after is a list of IDs which must have preceeded the execution of this
            rule
        squelch is a Boolean. If true, then if the 'match' regex matches some
            stuff that's already been timex annotated, those timexes are removed
            and no timex is added to the match. Defaults to false.
        case_sensitive is a Boolean indicating whether or not this rule should
            be matched case sensitively or not.
        deliminate_numbers is a Boolean indicating whether or not this rule
            requires the sentence to have deliminated numbers
